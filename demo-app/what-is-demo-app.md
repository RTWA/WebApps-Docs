# What is Demo App?

Demo App is exactly that, a demo. A showcase of what could be done with WebApps Apps.&#x20;

Demo App is built with other developers in mind. It provides the basic requirements for creating your very own WebApps App!

Having said that, Demo App is a fully functional Teams scores management system. Be it a fantasy football league or a school's sports day. The functionality in Demo App has you covered!
