When an update is available for WebApps, you will be notified in the Settings area.

Click on the link provided, or visit the [latest releases](https://github.com/RTWA/WebApps/releases/latest) section on GitHub to download the latest version.

The update process will require a very small amount of downtime for WebApps, as you will run through the small update process.
Updates can also include alterations to your database, so you should take a backup of your datbase before proceeding.


Having downloaded the latest version of WebApps from GitHub, extract the ZIP file to your WebApps Root directory (e.g. `C:\inetpub\WebApps` or `/var/www/html/WebApps`).

Navigate to your WebApps installation URL (e.g. `http://webapps.local`) and follow the Update wizard.
