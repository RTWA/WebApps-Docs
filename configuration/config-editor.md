If you use the Config Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems which can only be fixed by re-installation of the application.\
Use the Config Editor at your own risk.

Settings related to the use of WebApps are stored in the database with a key/value pair.

Config Editor allows you to manually change these key/value pairs, create your own, or delete keys.\
It is not recommended to make changes to any settings manually, rather adjust them on the appropriate settings page.

We provide this feature of WebApps for certain use cases only and no support is provided.

### Please note:&#x20;

Some Plugin's require creating a new config key/value, usually to provide a system URL.\
Make sure to check any instructions supplied with the Plugin.

This action will be performed using Config Editor, so take care when following the provided instructions.
