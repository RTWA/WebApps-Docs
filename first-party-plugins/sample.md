# Sample

The Sample Plugin is exactly that, a Sample.

Sample is built with developers in mind. It provides the basic requirements for creating your very own WebApps Plugin!

Sample only has one field `Message`, which is displayed between `<h1 />` tags.

### How to install Sample

Login to your WebApps installation as a user with Administrative Access rights, navigate to Settings and then Apps & Plugins. Click on the Get More Plugins button and locate Sample in the list.

Click on the Install button to download the Plugin, then click the Activate button to enable the Plugin.

### How to update Sample

Occasionally we publish updates to our Plugins. These will be displayed to users with Administrative Access rights on the Settings > Apps & Plugins page.

If an update is available for Sample, Update and Changelog buttons will appear. You can either update the Plugin direct from this screen, or find out how the Plugin has been changed by viewing the Changelog.

### How to uninstall Sample

Login to your WebApps installation as a user with Administrative Access rights, navigate to Settings and then Apps & Plugins. Locate the Sample card, and ensure it is not active. Then click on the Uninstall button.
