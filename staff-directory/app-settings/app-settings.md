# App Settings

The App Settings tab is used to manage some of the basic settings for the Staff Directory App.

## Managing Departments

### Add a new Department

The Manage Departments field has an embedded `Create a New Department` button.

Clicking the button will reveal the form to create a new department. Simply provide the department's name.

If you want the new department to be a child member of another department, select the parent department from the list.

Click the `Create Department` to complete the creation of the department!

### Modify an existing department

Select the department from the list to open the department properties pane.

From here you can rename the department, or make it a child department.

From the properties pane, you can also view and remove the members of the department or change or remove the head of the department.

{% hint style="info" %}
When changing the head of the department from this screen, the new department head must already be a member of the department!
{% endhint %}

You should use the `Save Changes` button, even when changing members or department head, although this kind of change should have already saved.

## Email Notifications

The next four options control whether, and to whom, an email is sent when a new record is created or deleted.

This option allows for a validation of work carried out by someone else, or to help collaborate between a team.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a record is created or deleted by the Microsoft Azure Integration system, then an email will not be sent, no matter what options are set here.
{% endhint %}

## Sample Data

This option is only displayed when you have not created any departments.

Selecting to install sample data will create various departments and members using random names.

You could use this to test if Staff Directory suits your needs. A quick way to remove this data after testing would be uninstall and then reinstall the Staff Directory App.
