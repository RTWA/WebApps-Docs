# Recycle Bin

Does what it says on the tin!

Records that are deleted (whether through Manage Staff or Microsoft Azure) will appear in here for up to 30 days.

You are able to recover the record easily - but be aware that a Microsoft Azure sync may remove them again if they are not in a sync group.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Staff Directory will automatically delete entries in the recycle bin after 30 days.
{% endhint %}
