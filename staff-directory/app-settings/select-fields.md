## Custom Fields

If no custom fields are created, then the custom fields section will not be displayed.

You can choose between two types of custom field as described below.

### Text Box

A straight forward text entry field. You must provide the name of the field.

### Select List

A dropdown selection list entry field. You must provide the name of the field and also a list of available options.

You should create one option per line, with an unlimited number of options available.&#x20;

The database zero-indexes each of the options, so the first line is 0, the second is 1 and so on.\
Because of this, once you have started creating records which use this field, you should avoid removing options from the field as the options below will be re-indexed.
