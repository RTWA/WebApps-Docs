# Manage Views

## All Staff

A default view, with all the options enabled is included by default, and is simply called `All Staff`.

You can select  and preview this view from the list on the right-hand side of the page. You are unable to make any changes to this view though.

## Create a view

Filter through the possible options to create you view as required. You can preview your current settings, without saving, at any time by clicking the `Preview` button.

You can choose whether to display all users, a single person, all people within a specific department, or all people based on a custom field (with a type of `Select List` only).

Four different display types are available, and all show varying degrees of detail. The easiest method find the most suitable option is select one and use the `Preview` button!

### Set who can view this

Use this button to set who can view the View.

You can select between allowing absolutely everyone (including **unauthenticated/guest** users!), all authenticated users or users within certain groups.

If you select users within certain groups, all Administrators will always be able to see all views.

### Choose table fields

If you select to have your View display as a table, you can use this option to select which fields are displayed within the table.

## Use your view

After you have configured a saved your view, the option to `Use This View` will appear. Clicking on this button, will present a small popup with the code required to embed this view into you website, SharePoint page, or other HTML based system.
