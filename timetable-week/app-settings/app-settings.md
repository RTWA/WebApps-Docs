# App Settings

The App Settings tab is used to manage some of the basic settings for the Timetable Week App.

# Manually override the current and next values

## Current Value

Changing this field will immediately change the "Current value" reported by the Timetable Week App.

## Next Value

Changing this field will change the "Next value" reported by the Timetable Week App. This value will become live at the next switchover date and time.

# Re-phrase the prefix text

With this setting you can change the phrases used for "This week is" and "Next week is". These phrases are used on the `auto` section of the API endpoint.

# Change switchover date and time

Here you can manually set the next switchover date and time. Please note, your entry must be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`

# View API Endpoint

This link will take you to the API endpoint for the Timetable Week App. This is the URL that you should request to gather the values to display in your own website, or on digital signage.
