# Set Week

This is the inteface you would provide to the people you rely on to set the data.

# Select the next option

Clicking either of the two buttons will set the "Next value" to either `Week A` or `Week B`.

## Or set a custom option:

If you wanted to set a custom value, for example to denote a closure, you can enter your custom value here and click on the embedded `Save` button.
This would be active from the next switchover date or time, if the closure was an emergency, that would need to be updated in [App Settings](app-settings/app-settings.md).
