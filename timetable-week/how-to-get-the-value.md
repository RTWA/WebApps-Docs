# How to get the value

Your application can retrieve the value from Timetable Week App in either JSON or XML format.

Make a GET request to the API endpoint URL from your [App Settings](app-settings/app-settings.md). The default is JSON format, if you require XML, change the extension on the last part of the URL.
