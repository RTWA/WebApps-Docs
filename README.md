# What are Apps?

Apps are complex Plugins. They allow the developer to produce a deeper level of customisation options, whilst still producing similar `<iframe />` code to embed into your site. Some Apps may also produce an endpoint, in either JSON or XML, which can be used for displaying information in a variety of ways, including on Digital Signage.

Apps could be made by the WebApps team, or submitted to [WebApps Studio](https://studio.getwebapps.uk) by other developers.

Either way, they are safe, secure and will work with WebApps, as all Studio Apps are checked and tested before being made available.

The Apps that are developed and maintained by the WebApps team are considered to be First-Party Apps, and their documentation can be found here.

Third-Party Apps (those made by other developers) may have their own documentation available.
