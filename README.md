# What are Plugins?

Plugins are used to create Blocks. Each Plugin will tell WebApps what fields the Block should have, and how the content should be displayed.

Plugins could be made by the WebApps team, or submitted to [WebApps Studio](https://studio.getwebapps.uk) by other developers.

Either way, they are safe, secure and will work with WebApps, as all Studio Plugins are checked and tested before being made available.

The Plugins that are developed and maintained by the WebApps team are considered to be First-Party Plugins, and information about them can be found here.

Third-Party Plugins (those made by other developers) may have their own information available.
